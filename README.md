Unitaskr is a productivity tool written in JavaScript and uses Backbone and Node.

Unitaskr is a productivity tool that allows  you to set tasks you want to perform, and add a timer.

Unitasking (a.k.a Monotasking), means creating blocks of time to perform  one task at a time. Thus, it's the opposite of multi-tasking.

It's easy to get caught up doing one task so much that you lose track of time and never end up getting to all the tasks on your todo list. 
Unitaskr aims to solve this problem.

I'm a fan of the Pomodoro technique, so I made it the timer default to 25 minutes.

Note that Unitaskr currently doesn't save anything, so if you refresh the page you will restart the program.
